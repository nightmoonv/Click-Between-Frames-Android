.This mod allows your clicks to be recorded between frames, which drastically increases the accuracy of the clicks during your game time. It is very good for players who play at 60fps, it increases and improves the gaming experience a little. (Ps: If you are a player who plays at 240hz or 120hz, let me tell you that you don't feel much of a change since the frames in which you can click increase and it seems that the difference is zero but in reality what happened is that since you play with fps /high hz the possibility of clicking increases and the difference is not very noticeable.



# How to use

Disable Any type of tps bypass when using this mod, because it doesn't make sense.



The mod comes with its own version of Physics Bypass in the mod options. Please note that not all lists or leaderboards that allow click beeletween frames will consider it legitimate!
